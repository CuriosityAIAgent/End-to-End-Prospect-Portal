# Source of Wealth Tool

An interactive private-banking workspace where a relationship manager creates a per-client Source of Wealth (SoW) assessment, works through the full due-diligence questionnaire with autosave, tracks completion and document checklists, and exports/prints the finished file.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 5000)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

- API contract (source of truth): `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` → codegen produces hooks (`@workspace/api-client-react`) and Zod (`@workspace/api-zod`)
- DB schema: `lib/db/src/schema/assessments.ts`, `lib/db/src/schema/prospects.ts`
- API routes: `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/assessments.ts`, `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/prospects.ts`
- Frontend app: `artifacts/sow-tool/` (Journey home `/`, Workspace `/assessment/:id`, Pipeline `/prospecting`, Prospect `/prospect/:id`)
- Journey derivation (source of truth for the unified home): `artifacts/sow-tool/src/lib/journey.ts` (`buildJourney`, `stageCounts`, 5-stage map)
- Questionnaire content (source of truth): `artifacts/sow-tool/src/lib/sowCatalog.ts`
- Prospecting content (source of truth): `artifacts/sow-tool/src/lib/prospectingCatalog.ts` (systematic-brief sections + the `coldCallScript` talk track and `coldCallCapture` log fields)
- Completion calc: `artifacts/sow-tool/src/lib/progress.ts`
- AI (OpenAI Responses API + live web_search): `lib/integrations-openai-ai-server`, used by the briefing route

## Architecture decisions

- All questionnaire answers, document-checklist states, and the banker's "applicable categories" selection are stored in a single `data` jsonb column on `assessments`, keyed by the catalog item ids. The frontend owns the shape; the backend just persists the blob. This keeps the schema stable as the questionnaire evolves.
- `reviewType`/`riskRating` are optional (not nullable) in the OpenAPI contract; routes map DB `null` → `undefined` via a `serialize` helper so response parsing passes.
- `PUT /assessments/:id` is the autosave + sign-off endpoint; an empty update body is a safe no-op (returns the current record) rather than an error.
- The document checklist uses string states from `documentStates`: `not_applicable | outstanding | received | verified`.
- Prospects mirror the assessments pattern: a single `data` jsonb blob (keyed by `prospectingCatalog` ids) plus a `briefing` jsonb and a `convertedAssessmentId` pointer. The frontend owns the data shape.
- The AI briefing route (`POST /prospects/:id/briefing`) calls the OpenAI Responses API with the `web_search` tool, parses the model's JSON, collects `url_citation` annotations as sources, and rejects empty output (502) rather than persisting a hollow briefing.
- `POST /prospects/:id/convert` runs select-check + insert-assessment + update-prospect inside one transaction with a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` row lock, so concurrent converts can't create duplicate assessments; a second convert returns 409. The new assessment carries the prospect profile/segment/briefing into its `data` blob.

## Product

- Journey home (`/`): one continuous end-to-end view of every relationship (prospects + onboarding assessments) on a single 5-stage rail — Identify → Cold Call → Brief → Meet → Onboard. Derived purely on the frontend (no backend stage column) via `lib/journey.ts`: a "Next Actions" worklist, live per-stage counts, stage filters, overview-derived metrics, and both Add Prospect / New Assessment dialogs. Replaces the former separate Dashboard + Prospecting landing areas.
- Assessment workspace: sectioned questionnaire (profile, applicable wealth categories with per-document checklists, source of funds, plausibility checks, red flags, sign-off, master checklist), debounced autosave, live completion %, status/risk controls, export/print, delete.
- Prospecting: pipeline overview (totals, briefed, converted) and a prospect list; create prospects.
- Prospect workspace: an end-to-end flow — (1) a cold-call script (structured talk track, live-personalised with the prospect name/RM/anchor, plus call-outcome log fields); (2) an AI pre-meeting briefing (live web search) showing summary, talking points, referral routes, recommended approach and cited sources; the systematic prospecting brief (5 profile dimensions, 3 channels, 4 operational questions) with debounced autosave; print; and (3) convert to a client SoW assessment (whose questionnaire is itself the meeting question guide).
